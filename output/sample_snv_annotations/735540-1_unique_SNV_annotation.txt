YDL228C	 ORF Dubious Dubious open reading frame; unlikely to encode a functional protein, based on available experimental and comparative sequence data; almost completely overlaps the verified gene SSB1
YNL096C	RPS7B ORF Verified Protein component of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit; interacts with Kti11p; deletion causes hypersensitivity to zymocin; homologous to mammalian ribosomal protein S7, no bacterial homolog; RPS7B has a paralog, RPS7A, that arose from the whole genome duplication; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress
YEL054C	RPL12A ORF Verified Ribosomal 60S subunit protein L12A; rpl12a rpl12b double mutant exhibits slow growth and slow translation; homologous to mammalian ribosomal protein L12 and bacterial L11; RPL12A has a paralog, RPL12B, that arose from the whole genome duplication
YGL259W	YPS5 ORF Uncharacterized Protein with similarity to GPI-anchored aspartic proteases; such proteases are Yap1p and Yap3p
YIL106W	MOB1 ORF Verified Component of the mitotic exit network; associates with and is required for the activation and Cdc15p-dependent phosphorylation of the Dbf2p kinase; required for cytokinesis and cell separation; component of the CCR4 transcriptional complex; relocalizes from cytoplasm to the nuclear periphery upon DNA replication stress
YGR254W	ENO1 ORF Verified Enolase I, a phosphopyruvate hydratase; catalyzes conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate during glycolysis and the reverse reaction during gluconeogenesis; expression repressed in response to glucose; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress; N-terminally propionylated in vivo; ENO1 has a paralog, ENO2, that arose from the whole genome duplication
YNL268W	LYP1 ORF Verified Lysine permease; one of three amino acid permeases (Alp1p, Can1p, Lyp1p) responsible for uptake of cationic amino acids
CAG78205	   
YPL258C	THI21 ORF Verified Hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP) and HMP-phosphate kinase; involved in thiamine biosynthesis; member of a gene family with THI20 and THI22; functionally redundant with Thi20p
YGL258W	VEL1 ORF Verified Protein of unknown function; highly induced in zinc-depleted conditions and has increased expression in NAP1 deletion mutants; VEL1 has a paralog, YOR387C, that arose from a single-locus duplication
YER117W	RPL23B ORF Verified Ribosomal 60S subunit protein L23B; homologous to mammalian ribosomal protein L23 and bacterial L14; RPL23B has a paralog, RPL23A, that arose from the whole genome duplication
YCR105W	ADH7 ORF Verified NADPH-dependent medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase; has broad substrate specificity; member of the cinnamyl family of alcohol dehydrogenases; may be involved in fusel alcohol synthesis or in aldehyde tolerance
YLR460C	 ORF Uncharacterized Member of the quinone oxidoreductase family; up-regulated in response to the fungicide mancozeb; possibly up-regulated by iodine
YOR043W	WHI2 ORF Verified Protein required for full activation of the general stress response; required with binding partner Psr1p, possibly through Msn2p dephosphorylation; regulates growth during the diauxic shift; negative regulator of G1 cyclin expression
YHR056C	RSC30 ORF Verified Component of the RSC chromatin remodeling complex; non-essential gene required for regulation of ribosomal protein genes and the cell wall/stress response; null mutants are osmosensitive; RSC30 has a paralog, RSC3, that arose from the whole genome duplication
